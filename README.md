# 🛡️ TrustVault  
### Blockchain-Based Secure Digital Evidence Platform

> Making digital evidence tamper-proof, verifiable, and court-admissible

---

## 📌 Overview

**TrustVault** is a secure digital evidence management platform that combines **AI-driven authenticity analysis** with **blockchain-backed immutability** to ensure the integrity, traceability, and credibility of digital evidence throughout its lifecycle.

Digital evidence fails in courts not because it exists, but because it cannot be **proven unchanged**. TrustVault enforces this guarantee by design.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Digital evidence is frequently rejected due to:

- Tampering risks
- Deepfake and manipulated media
- Broken or unverifiable chain-of-custody
- Manual and opaque forensic verification

Traditional systems rely on trust. Courts require **proof**.

---

## 💡 Solution

TrustVault creates an **immutable, verifiable chain-of-custody** using cryptographic hashing, AI-based authenticity analysis, and blockchain logging.

### Core Principles
- Immutability over assumptions
- Verification over trust
- Automation over manual checks
- Transparency for courts

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🔐 Core Features
- Secure digital evidence upload
- SHA-256 cryptographic hash generation
- Blockchain-based chain-of-custody logging
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### 🤖 AI Verification
- Deepfake detection
- Metadata anomaly analysis
- Evidence Trust Score (0–100)

### ⛓️ Blockchain
- Immutable storage of evidence hashes
- Tamper-proof access logs
- Independent verification without platform reliance

### ⚖️ Court Tools

## ⭐ Unique Selling Points

| Feature | TrustVault | Traditional Systems |
|------|-----------|--------------------|
| Storage | Decentralized (Blockchain) | Centralized |
| Verification | AI-assisted | Manual |
| Integrity | Cryptographic & Immutable | Assumed |
| Trust Metric | Quantified (0–100) | Binary |
| Tamper Alerts | Real-time | None |

## 🧠 Evidence Trust Score

A reliability metric calculated using:
- Hash consistency
- Metadata integrity
- AI authenticity confidence
- Access pattern anomalies

**Score Interpretation:**
- **90–100:** Highly reliable
- **70–89:** Needs review
- **<70:** Potentially compromised

> The Trust Score assists verification — it does not make legal judgments.

---

## 🔄 Workflow

1. Evidence is uploaded
2. SHA-256 hash is generated
3. AI analyzes authenticity and metadata
4. Hash and access logs are recorded on blockchain
5. Trust Score is calculated
6. Any modification triggers an integrity alert
7. Courts independently verify using the stored hash
